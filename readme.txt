Reboot/2 v1.00 - Simple example of how to reboot OS/2 1.3 and 2.0.

This is a 16 bit app that uses the DOS.SYS driver to reboot OS/2.  If
you have dos support installed then you can use this.  This technique
will even work in a DOS box, but I can't shutdown the file system from
DOS, so I choose not to make this a FAPI app.
